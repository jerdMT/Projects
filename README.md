# Projects
## R projects, research, etc..

In this respository you will find three stand alone projects:
* My undergraduate senior reseach project concerning disorder magenetic rotors, simulated with openGL
* My past research with polymer rings, deals with LAAMPS molecular dynamics input
* A final project for a graduate computational statisics course, classifies exoplanets from time series data.
