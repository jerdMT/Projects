# C++, R projects/ Research

In this respository you will find three stand alone projects. My undergraduate senior reseach project concerning disorder rotors, my current research with polymer rings, and a final project for a graduate computational statisics course. The latter was an effort to highlight the pitfalls of unbalanced datasets; descriptions for the former can be found in the reseach poster.
