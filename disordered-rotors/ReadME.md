The following is code the simulates and stores data of magnetic rotors as the devolve to their lowest energy configuration. 

I've produced a few sample plots from the data rotor.cpp has produced.

Visulization is produced with openGL and GNU plot.

*At present, I am seeing some irregularities/unexpected behavior in the figures that need to be addressed. Some seeds from the Mersenne twister PRNG are producing different initial magnetization values and this is an issue. (As I should expect the same value independent of seed? see data.txt)*
